# AI-Meme-Generator-using-Image-and-Caption-Synthesis

This project is an AI-powered meme generator designed to automatically create humorous and engaging memes by combining image data with text captions. The generator can function in two modes: static and dynamic. In the static mode, the system selects captions from a pre-existing dataset. In the dynamic mode, it uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate new captions based on a given prompt or randomly. This allows the system to generate context-aware, funny captions that pair well with meme images.

The goal of this project is to automate the meme creation process, making it faster and more creative while minimizing the effort required by the user. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and basic image processing techniques, the project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used in content generation for entertainment and social media.

The project was developed using Python and key libraries such as TensorFlow, Transformers, PIL, and OpenCV. It consists of a Jupyter Notebook where all major components—such as data loading, caption generation, image overlay, and final meme output—are implemented step by step. The input includes a captions.tsv file containing sample image URLs and corresponding captions. Output memes are saved in a generated_memes/ folder and also bundled into a downloadable ZIP file.

This project not only showcases the capabilities of combining NLP and image manipulation but also offers a fun and engaging way to explore the intersection of machine learning and humor.
